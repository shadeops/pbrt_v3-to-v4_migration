# Scene Description Changes from pbrt-v3 to pbrt-v4

## Preamble
This is not meant to be the official document representing the changes between pbrt-v3 and pbrt-v4, I'll leave that to Matt's much more capable hands. These are my notes during the process of updating an exporter from v3 to v4. I am making these public to aid others in the transition until a formal page is created by Matt. The changes listed are deduced from reading through the source code of https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4. As pbrt-v4 is still an early release and changing rapidly expect these notes to be out of sync at times. When in doubt, trust the code! :)

### Updating an exporter while the interface is still undergoing changes?
Yup, I'm an idiot. But its exciting to follow the developments and try out the changes!
